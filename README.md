# Paper-sharing

## Some rules:
1. The current papers are limited to detection in Semi-suprevised and Self-supervised, maybe add other field later.
2. You can add the paper that recommend in the issue if u want, and maybe i'll deal with them one by one.
3. The temporary update plan is one every day in English.
4. Hope I can keep on, make progress and bring you some valuable knowledge in a limited time :)
